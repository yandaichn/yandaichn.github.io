Hi! I am a junior-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS, Tsinghua](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. **Yao Class**, directed by Turing Award Laureate Andrew Chi-Chih Yao). I am also pursuing a minor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [DMS, Tsinghua](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I am broadly interested in learning theory, especially in reinforcement learning theory. Check my [publications](publications) or my [CV (PDF)](CV_Yan.pdf) for more information!

### About My Name
Dai (戴) is my surname and Yan (言) is my given name. In Chinese, the surnames come *before* the given names --- that's why DAI Yan is my preferred name ordering.

### Services
* Conference reviewing: AISTATS 2022, NeurIPS 2022, AISTATS 2023.
