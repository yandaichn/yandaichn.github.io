Hi! I have just graduated from [IIIS, Tsinghua](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (*a.k.a.* **Yao Class**, directed by the Turing Award Laureate [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)), earning a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology. I am extremely grateful to [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/), [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net/), [Prof. Simon S. Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/), and [Prof. Suvrit Sra](https://optml.mit.edu/) who introduced me to the world of learning theory!

My research interests lie broadly in **Learning Theory**, e.g., Reinforcement Learning Theory and Deep Learning Theory. Check my [publications](publications) and [CV (PDF)](CV_Yan.pdf) for more information!

I am also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
