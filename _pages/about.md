Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at [**Operations Research Center (ORC), MIT**](https://orc.mit.edu/) where I am fortunate enough to be advised by [**Prof. Patrick Jaillet**](https://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/). I am also affiliated with [**Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), MIT**](https://lids.mit.edu/).

Prior to MIT, I graduated from [**Yao Class, Tsinghua**](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in June 2024 and earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology. I am extremely grateful to [**Prof. Longbo Huang**](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/), [**Prof. Haipeng Luo**](https://haipeng-luo.net/), [**Prof. Simon S. Du**](https://simonshaoleidu.com/), and [**Prof. Suvrit Sra**](https://optml.mit.edu/) who introduced me to the world of learning theory!

My research interests lie broadly in **Learning Theory**, especially Reinforcement Learning Theory and Deep Learning Theory -- check my [**publications**](publications) or [**CV (PDF)**](CV_Yan.pdf) for more information. I am open to other topics, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!
