Hi! I am a final-year (senior) undergrad majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS, Tsinghua](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (*a.k.a.* **Yao Class**, directed by the Turing Award Laureate [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

My research interests lie broadly in **Learning Theory**, e.g., Reinforcement Learning Theory and Deep Learning Theory. Check my [publications](publications) and [CV (PDF)](CV_Yan.pdf) for more information!

Feel free to reach out if you have anything to chat!
