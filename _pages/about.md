I am a sophomore in Computer Science and Technology major at [IIIS, Tsinghua](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. **Yao Class**). I am also studying a minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [DMS, Tsinghua](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I am interested in machine learning theory, especially multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning.

### About My Name
Dai (戴) is my surname, while Yan (言) is my given name. In Chinese, the surnames come *before* the given names. DAI Yan is also my preferred name.
