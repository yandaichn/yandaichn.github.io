I am a junior-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS, Tsinghua](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. **Yao Class**, directed by Turing Award Laureate Andrew Chi-Chih Yao). My research interests lie in learning theory, especially reinforcement learning theory and machine learning theory.
