I am a sophomore in Computer Science and Technology major at [IIIS, Tsinghua](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. **Yao Class**). I am also studying a minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [DMS, Tsinghua](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning theory, especially in reinforcement learning. Check my [publications](publications) or my [CV (PDF)](CV.pdf) for more information!
