I became a water polo player in our university team in my freshman year. We won 2nd place in the National Collegiate Water Polo Championships in 2021!

I also enjoy swimming. In the Swimming Competition of Tsinghua (马约翰杯游泳比赛), I won 1st place in men's 100m butterfly, 3rd place in men's 200m medleys, and 5th place in men's 200m freestyle.
