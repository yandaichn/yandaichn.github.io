I co-founded the Tsinghua Water Polo Club in my freshman year. We won 2nd place in the National Collegiate Water Polo Championships 2021!

When visiting MIT in Spring 2023, I competed in the MIT Intramurals Water Polo League (IM League) --- our team won the first! After joining MIT as a PhD student, I'm also a member of the MIT Water Polo club.

As a key ingredient in water polo, I enjoy swimming as well. In Tsinghua Swimming Competition (马约翰杯游泳比赛 in Chinese), I won 1st place in men's 100m butterfly, 3rd place in men's 200m medleys, and 5th place in men's 200m freestyle. I'm also one of the co-founders of Tsinghua Amateur Swimming Team.

Besides aquatics, I also recently developed interests in Figure Skating, Ice Hockey, Sailing, and Bouldering (a rapidly growing list!)
