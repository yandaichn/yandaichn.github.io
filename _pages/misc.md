I became a water polo player in our university team in my freshman year. We won second place in the National Collegiate Water Polo Championships in 2021.

I am also quite interested in swimming. In the Swimming Competition of Tsinghua (马约翰杯游泳比赛), I won first place in men's 100m butterfly, third place in men's 200m medleys, and fifth place in men's 200m freestyle.

I am also the leader of our institute's [swimming club](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.php?v=show&cid=670&id=9386) & swimming team.
